# Jashan Jattana – Student Portfolio

This repository contains my personal student portfolio website for the DevOps course.

## About the Portfolio

- Built as part of COMP-4001: Developing in a DevOps Environment  
- Shows my profile, skills, and sample projects  
- Includes a link to the Banking Web App that I deployed using Docker, NGINX, and Kubernetes in later modules  

## What this site demonstrates

- Basic front-end skills (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap)
- Ability to quickly modify and redeploy a template
- Integration with a backend microservice (banking app) through the “Banking App” link on the Projects section
